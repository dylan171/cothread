/* Coroutine frame switching for 64-bit x86
 *
 * The AMD64 architecture provides 16 general 64-bit registers together with 16
 * 128-bit SSE registers and 8 80-bit x87 floating point registers.
 *
 * Registers "owned" by caller:
 *   rbx, rsp, rbp, r12-r15, mxcsr (control bits), x87 CW
 * The callee must preserve the mxcsr control bits and the x87 control word.
 * All other registers are volatile and do not need to be preserved.
 *
 * General registers and their roles:
 *
 *   rax     Result register
 *   rbx     Must be preserved
 *   rcx     Fourth argument
 *   rdx     Third argument
 *   rsp     Stack pointer, must be preserved
 *   rbp     Frame pointer, must be preserved
 *   rsi     Second argument
 *   rdi     First argument
 *   r8      Fifth argument
 *   r9      Sixth argument
 *   r10-r11 Scratch
 *   r12-r15 Must be preserved
