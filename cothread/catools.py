'''Pure Python ctypes interface to EPICS libca Channel Access library

Supports the following methods:

    caget(pvs, ...)
        Returns a single snapshot of the current value of each PV.

    caput(pvs, values, ...)
        Writes values to one or more PVs.

    camonitor(pvs, callback, ...)
        Receive notification each time any of the listed PVs changes.

    connect(pvs, ...)
        Can be used to establish PV connection before using the PV.

See the documentation for the individual functions for more details on using
them.'''

        all_updates = False, notify_disconnect = False)

    Creates a subscription to one or more PVs, returning a subscription
    object for each PV.  If a single PV is given then a single subscription
    object is returned, otherwise a list of subscriptions is returned.

    Subscriptions will remain active until the close() method is called on
    the returned subscription object.

    The precise way in which the callback routine is called on updates
    depends on whether pvs is a single name or a list of names.  If it is
    single name then it is called as

        callback(value)

    for each update.  If pvs is a list of names then each update is
    reported as
    
        callback(value, index)

    where index is the position in the original array of pvs of the name
    generating this update.

    Every value has .name and .ok fields: if the channel has disconnected
    then .ok will be False, otherwise the value is an augmented
    representation of the updated value; for more detail on values see the
    documentation for caget.

    The parameters modify the behaviour as follows:

    events
        This identifies the type of update which will be notified.  A
        bit-wise or of any the following are possible:

        DBE_VALUE       Notify normal value changes
        DBE_LOG         Notify archive value changes
        DBE_ALARM       Notify alarm state changes
        DBE_PROPERTY    Notify property changes
            
    datatype
    format
    count
        These all specify the format in which data is returned.  See the
        documentation for caget for details.

    all_updates
        If this is True then every update received from channel access will
        be delivered to the callback, otherwise multiple updates received
        between callback queue dispatches will be merged into the most recent
        value.
            If updates are being merged then the value returned will be
        augmented with a field .update_count recording how many updates
        occurred on this value.

    notify_disconnect
        If this is True then IOC disconnect events will be reported by
        calling the callback with a ca_nothing error with .ok False,
        otherwise only valid values will be passed to the callback routine.

def caget(pvs, **kargs):
    '''caget(pvs,
        timeout = 5, datatype = None,
        format = FORMAT_RAW, count = 0, throw = True)

    Retrieves the value from one or more PVs.  If a single PV is given then
    a single value is returned, otherwise a list of values is returned.

    Every value returned has the following fields:

        .ok     Set to True if the data is good, False if there was an error
                (and throw=False has been selected).

        .name   Name of the pv.

    If ok is False then the .errorcode field is set to the appropriate ECA_
    error code and str(value) will return an appropriate error message.
    
    The various arguments control the behaviour of caget as follows:

    timeout
        Timeout for the caget operation.  This can be a timeout interval
        in seconds, an absolute deadline (in time() format) as a single
        element tuple, or None to specify that no timeout will occur.  Note
        that a timeout of 0 will timeout immediately if any waiting is
        required.

    datatype
        This controls the format of the data that will be requested.  This
        can be any of the following:

        1.  None (the default).  In this case the "native" datatype provided
            by the channel will be returned.

        2.  A DBR_ value, one of DBR_STRING, DBR_SHORT, DBR_FLOAT, DBR_ENUM,
            DBR_CHAR, DBR_LONG or DBR_DOUBLE.

        3.  A python type compatible with any of the above values, such as
            int, float or str.

        4.  Any numpy dtype compatible with any of the above values.

        5.  The special value DBR_CHAR_STR.  This is used to request a char
            array which is then converted to a Python string on receipt.  It
            is not sensible to specify count with this option.

        6.  One of the special values DBR_STSACK_STRING or DBR_CLASS_NAME.

    format
        This controls how much auxilliary information will be returned with
        the retrieved data, and can be one of the following:

        FORMAT_RAW
            The data is returned unaugmented except for the .name field.
        
        FORMAT_TIME
            The data is augmented by the data timestamp together with
            .alarm .status and .severity fields.
        
        FORMAT_CTRL
            The data is augmented by channel access "control" fields.  This
            set of fields depends on the underlying datatype:

            DBR_SHORT, DBR_CHAR, DBR_LONG
                The alarm .status and .severity fields together with .units
                and limit fields:
                .upper_disp_limit, .lower_disp_limit,
                .upper_alarm_limit, .lower_alarm_limit,
                .upper_warning_limit, .lower_warning_limit,
                .upper_ctrl_limit, .lower_ctrl_limit.
            
            DBR_FLOAT, DBR_DOUBLE
                As above together with a .precision field.
            
            DBR_ENUM
                Alarm .status and .severity fields together with .enums, a
                list of possible enumeration strings.
            
            DBR_STRING
                _CTRL format is not supported for this field type, and
                FORMAT_TIME data is returned instead.

    count
        If specified this can be used to limit the number of waveform values
        retrieved from the server.

    throw
        Normally an exception will be raised if the channel cannot be
        connected to or if there is a data error.  If this is set to False
        then instead for each failing PV an empty value with .ok == False is
        returned.

    The format of values returned depends on the number of values requested
    for each PV.  If only one value is requested then the value is returned
    as a scalar, otherwise as a numpy array.'''

    Writes values to one or more PVs.  If multiple PVs are given together
    with multiple values then both lists or arrays should match in length,
    and values[i] is written to pvs[i].  Otherwise, if a single value is
    given or if repeat_value=True is specified, the same value is written
    to all PVs.

    The arguments control the behavour of caput as follows:

    repeat_value
        When writing an array value to an array of PVs ensures that the
        same array of values is written to each PV.

    timeout
        Timeout for the caput operation.  This can be a timeout interval
        in seconds, an absolute deadline (in time() format) as a single
        element tuple, or None to specify that no timeout will occur.  Note
        that a timeout of 0 will timeout immediately if any waiting is
        required.

    wait
        If wait=True is specified then channel access put with callback is
        invoked, and the caput operation will wait until the server
        acknowledges successful completion before returning.

    datatype
        If a datatype is specified then the values being written will be
        coerced to the specified datatype before been transmitted.  As well
        as standard datatypes (see caget), DBR_PUT_ACKT or DBR_PUT_ACKS can
        be specified.

    throw
        Normally an exception will be raised if the channel cannot be
        connected to or if an error is reported.  If this is set to False
        then instead for each failing PV a sentinel value with .ok == False
        is returned.

    The return value for each PV is a structure with two fields: .ok and
    .name, and possibly a third field .errorcode.  If multiple PVs are
    specified then a list of values is returned.

    If caput completed succesfully then .ok is True and .name is the
    corresponding PV name.  If throw=False was specified and a put failed
    then .errorcode is set to the appropriate ECA_ error code.'''

    Establishes a connection to one or more PVs.  A single PV or a list of PVs
    can be given.  This does not normally need to be called, as the ca...()
    routines will establish their own connections as required, but after a
    successful connection we can guarantee that caput(..., wait=False) will
    complete immediately without suspension.

    This routine can safely be called repeatedly without any extra side
    effects.

    The following arguments affect the behaviour of connect as follows:

    cainfo
        By default a simple ca_nothing value is returned, but if this flag is
        set then a ca_info structure is returned recording the following
        information about the connection:
        
        .ok         True iff the channel was successfully connected 
        .name       Name of PV
        .state      State of channel as an integer.  Look up
                    .state_strings[.state] for textual description.
        .host       Host name and port of server providing this PV
        .read       True iff read access to this PV
        .write      True iff write access to this PV
        .count      Data count of this channel
        .datatype   Underlying channel datatype as DBR_ value.  Look up
                    .datatype_strings[.datatype] for description.

    wait
        Normally the connect routine will not return until the requested
        connection is established.  If wait=False is set then a connection
        request will be queued and connect will unconditionally succeed.

    timeout
        How long to wait for the connection to be established.

    throw
        Normally an exception will be raised if the channel cannot be
        connected to.  If this is set to False then instead for each failing
        PV a sentinel value with .ok == False is returned.
