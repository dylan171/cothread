Cothread Architecture Notes
===========================

Some notes on key architectural issues in the :mod:`cothread` scheduler.


Coroutine Switching
-------------------

There are precisely 7 calls to :func:`switch` in the :mod:`cothread` library,
and it's crucial that they work together correctly.  These calls are (in order
of appearance in the code).

- During scheduler creation (in the :func:`.create` method of
  :class:`_Scheduler`) we create a separate scheduler task and switch to that.
  This should be called from the main parent task (ie, when it ends, the
  application terminates).

- As soon as the scheduler has been initialised, control is returned to the
  main task.  This is in :func:`.__scheduler`, which carries a top level loop
  for restarting the scheduler.

- If the main scheduler loop :func:`.__schedule_loop` raises an exception,
  control is switched to the main parent task with a special
  :const:`.__WAKEUP_INTERRUPT` return code.  The main task will at this point
  normally be waiting for a normal scheduler wake up.

- The :func:`.__tick` dispatcher switches to all ready tasks in turn passing a
  wakeup code, either :const:`.__WAKEUP_NORMAL` or :const:`.__WAKEUP_TIMEOUT`.

- If :func:`.poll_scheduler` has been called, and thus
  :func:`.__poll_callback` is set, the routine :func:`.__poll_suspend` will
  switch back to the suspended :func:`.poll_scheduler` call.  In this case
  special polling arguments are passed (this should be a list of (descriptor,
  flags) pairs, together with a timeout), and a list of active descriptors
  should be returned.

- :func:`.poll_scheduler` defines the other side of this switch: a list of
  ready descriptors is passed in a switch to the scheduler task, and the
  polling arguments described above are returned from the
  :func:`.poll_scheduler` call -- unless a :const:`.__WAKEUP_INTERRUPT` switch
  has occurred!

- The normal place where control is switched to the scheduler is in the middle
  of :func:`.wait_until`.  We have to pass an empty list (to be compatible
  with the :func:`.poll_scheduler` switch), and a wakeup reason should be
  returned.
